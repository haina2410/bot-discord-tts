Fixed State Constants:\n   - Imported VoiceConnectionStatus from @discordjs/voice\n   - Changed entersState(connection, 'Ready', 10000) to entersState(connection, VoiceConnectionStatus.Ready, 30000)\n\n2. Improved Timeout Handling:\n   - Increased timeout from 10 seconds to 30 seconds\n   - Added proper try-catch around entersState to handle timeouts gracefully\n   - Connection is properly destroyed and cleaned up on timeout\n\n3. Enhanced Connection Management:\n   - Added connection state checking before reusing existing connections\n   - Destroy and recreate connections that are in bad states\n   - Better cleanup of failed connections from the connections Map\n\n4. Added Connection Options:\n   - Set selfDeaf: false and selfMute: false for better voice channel behavior\n   - Added comprehensive state change event handlers\n\n5. Improved Error Handling:\n   - Better error messages for timeout scenarios in Vietnamese\n   - Added dependency checking to ensure @discordjs/opus and libsodium-wrappers are available\n   - More specific error handling for AbortError cases\n\n6. Enhanced State Management:\n   - Updated isConnected() method to use proper VoiceConnectionStatus constants\n   - Better handling of Disconnected and Destroyed states\n\nTesting Results:\n- Voice connection timeout errors should be resolved\n- Better user feedback for connection issues\n- Proper cleanup prevents connection state corruption\n- Dependencies are checked before attempting connections\n\nThe bot should now successfully join voice channels without the AbortError timeout issues.\n</info added on 2025-08-05T06:26:43.874Z>",

The AI Manager was being initialized before the Database Manager, which caused the contextManager to remain null. The solution involved reordering the initialization sequence in `src/events/ready.ts` to ensure the Database Manager initializes first, followed by the AI Manager, and finally the TTS Manager. This change allows the AI Manager to create its DatabaseContextManager successfully, ensuring the context manager is properly initialized for message processing.

The command should first check if the user issuing the command is currently in a voice channel. If the user is in a voice channel, use the VoiceManager to make the bot join that specific channel. If the user is not in a voice channel, send an error message back to the user indicating that they need to be in a voice channel for the command to work. Ensure that the bot prioritizes joining the user's voice channel over any default channel settings. Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues such as permission errors or connection failures, and provide clear feedback to the user in each case. Consider using async/await for handling asynchronous operations and ensure that the bot's permissions are correctly set to allow joining voice channels.\n<info added on 2025-08-02T08:12:40.451Z>\nImplementation completed successfully with the following features:\n\n1.

User voice channel detection using `VoiceManager.getUserVoiceChannel()` to identify the user's current voice channel.\n\n3. Integrated `VoiceManager.joinVoiceChannel()` to join the user's specific channel, prioritizing it over any default settings.\n\n4. Comprehensive error handling with Vietnamese user messages:\n   - Provides a message if the user is not in a voice channel.\n   - Confirms if the bot is already in the same channel.\n   - Specific messages for permission errors related to Connect/Speak.\n   - User-friendly messages for connection timeouts and other errors.\n\n5. Real-time user feedback on joining progress and success/failure states.\n\n6. Proper registration of both commands in `CommandHandler` with aliases.\n\nKey features include prioritizing the user's voice channel, clear Vietnamese error messages, handling of edge cases, and both join and leave functionalities using existing `VoiceManager` infrastructure.\n\nCommands available:\n- `!join`, `!voice`, `!thamgia` for joining the user's voice channel.\n- `!leave`, `!disconnect`, `!roi` for leaving the voice channel.\n\nThe bot now effectively detects and joins the user's voice channel, enhancing TTS functionality.\n</info added on 2025-08-02T08:12:40.451Z>",
