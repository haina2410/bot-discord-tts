## Discord AI Chatbot
### Main features
- Listen to a channel A (configurable)'s messages and response.
- Join a voice channel and listen to messages in channel A then response through a TTS service (TTS service information will provide below).
- The response is generated with AI.
- This discord bot can use function calling to read user data base on their discord ID, to give more information about that user for more contextful (and in-character) response.
- Not just reading, it can write data about an user (base on their discord ID) for future context.

>[!IMPORTANT]
So the main idea is the more time this bot stays in the server, the more knowledge it learns about that serverâ€™s members.

### Database
We should have a database to store user information, you decide the columns and database type (SQL or non-SQL)

### TTS Service
This is a required format of the TTS service, the bot must send a POST request to https://viettelai.vn/tts/speech_synthesis with body below to get the audio:
```json
{
  "speed":"1.0",
  "text": {tts_payload},
  "token": {token},
  "tts_return_option": 2 // 2 means wav and 3 means mp3, you can choose what suitable,
  "voice": "hn-quynhanh",
  "without_filter": false
}
```
